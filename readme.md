# My Homepage

## About

This is a small website that I created to act as my new tab page, allowing me to access the sites I use frequently faster.

## Screenshots

Hereâ€™s a preview of what it looks like:

## How To Use

If you want to use this as your new tab page, I recommend downloading the [New Tab Redirect](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) extension for Chrome. Once installed, set the redirect URL to the location of this homepage.
